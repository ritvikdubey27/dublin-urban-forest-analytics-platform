# Dublin Urban Forest Analytics Platform

## Overview
The **Dublin Urban Forest Analytics Platform** is an advanced data-driven solution designed to analyze and visualize urban forest data for Dublin. The platform leverages data science and geospatial techniques to provide insights into the health, growth, and environmental impact of urban trees.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess urban forest data, standardize formats, and engineer meaningful features for analysis.
- **Analysis Development**: Perform in-depth analyses such as species distribution, health assessment, spatial pattern recognition, and growth trends.
- **Visualization**: Build interactive dashboards and maps to explore findings and prioritize urban forest maintenance.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide user-friendly guides and technical documentation for seamless platform adoption.
